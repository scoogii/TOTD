# Thought of the Day ðŸ’­ (TOTD)

A mobile app where users write about any thought they have for the day.
Users will be able to log one thought daily and can check previous thoughts using another tab that
has a calendar view.

I aim to one day list this app publicly on the App Store but at the moment my knowledge on security
and authentication is quite limited. Given the sensitive information that a user could keep on this
app, learning through working in the software development industry will give me an idea on how to make this app secure for all users
to enjoy.
